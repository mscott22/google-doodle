# Google Doodle

## Brainstorm Ideas

*Google Doodle Topic: First Day of Spring*
My topic is the first day of spring. I love the first day of spring because I love flowers and the smell of rain. The first day of spring this year is Tuesday, March 20th, 2018. The past google doodles I have researched contain flowers in them and are animated to bloom or to have some type of rain showers on them.  
		
When I think of spring I think of the saying, “April showers bring May flowers”. So I want my doodle to include lots of flowers and possibly rain of some animation. I would like the color scheme to be pastel colors. I found a color pallet that I liked that is included on my mood board file. As far as the flower styles go, I would like them to be hand drawn looking and not super perfect or to much like a cheap clip art flower version.

I would like flowers to be blooming in the background that frame the word "Google" in the center in the color white. The flowers would be different pastel shades to create contrast. Another idea I was thinking was that the each letter of the word Google could be shaped as different trees with different colors of flowers that could be animated to bloom at the same time.

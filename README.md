# Google Doodle

## Brainstorm Ideas

*Topic: First Day of Spring 
* Rain  
* Flowers blooming
* Pastel Color pallet- pink, yellow, orange, green, light blue, purple.
* Doodled flowers
* I would like flowers to be blooming in the background that frame the word "Google" in the center in the color white. The flowers would be different pastel shades to create contrast. Another idea I was thinking was that the each letter of the word Google could be shaped as different trees with different colors of flowers that could be animated to bloom at the same time.
